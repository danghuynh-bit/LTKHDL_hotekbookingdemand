**II. Project information:**

1. Overview dataset:
* Dataset article: [Hotel Booking Demand](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191?fbclid=IwAR3MbsC2yty_L4Y9ho3wwlE4GeEeqIzzemN1BdetAZ2cQf5eDYd-osoIZZc)
* Our team is working on a research project focused on datasets related to hotel demand, covering two main types of hotels: resort hotels and city hotels.
* The primary goal of this research is to gain insights into hotel operations, specifically in the context of hotel bookings. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to identify and understand various factors influencing hotel demand. This research contributes to a comprehensive analysis of trends, patterns, and potential development paths in the hospitality industry. The ultimate objective is to optimize booking processes and improve overall outcomes.
2. Notebook:
* Notebook `01_Collecting_Data`: Observation on two chosen datasets and produce a final raw dataset.
* Notebook `02_Preprocessing`: Preprocess data on those given features: categorical and numerical features.
* Notebook `03_Analyzing_Questions`: Propose questions and find the answers to gain insight into the problem.
    * *Question 1:* Which time of the year has most concellations?
    * *Question 2:* How the factors involving **customers' booking behaviour** contribute to the hotel's performance relating to **cancelation rate** or **repeated guests rate** ?
* Notebook `04_Reflection`: In this notebook, we delve into the challenges encountered, the knowledge gained from the project, and potential enhancements for the project.
